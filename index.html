        <h2>Kakoune, an amazing text editor</h2>
        <p>Recently I started using <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune">kakoune</a> as my primary text editor.
        It is a minimal text editor, it's inspired by vim, but the underpinning concept is a bit different.
        It's based on multiple selections and it tries to be more interactive than vim. For example, when you want to delete a line,
        you first select the line and then you press `d` to delete it. In this way you get visual feedback of what you're going to delete,
        and if you selected the wrong line, you can change your mind.
        In vim, instead, you start with the command to execute, and when you select the text object, it's too late.
        One other notable feature of kakoune is that it tries to have an orthogonal design of commands.
        That is, it tries to be rational about commands and their keymaps so that the basic features are kept to the minimum
        and I think it's also easier to remember the various commands and keymaps, since related commands have related keymaps.
        And don't forget about the very useful popup menu that gives you informations about the commands you're entering,
        this really helps in discovering and learning kakoune faster!
        Finally, the community is also a great added value, they're very nice and supportive and have always helped me, even with my really silly issues.
        So, what do you think about it? Let me know... Also, do you know about some other cool text editors out there?

        Ah, kakoune is also scriptable, but I'll talk about this in another blog post, I think.
